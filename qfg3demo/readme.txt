  Game version 1.000 (June 12, 1992)
  
  Interpreter version 1.001.021

  Make sure LOFSA absolute is checked in the version detector. SCICompanion does not seem to auto-detect this for this game.

  This game does not contain 997.VOC, so the one from the QFG1VGA demo has been included.

  The system scripts PRINT, SAVE, and FILE have been restored to allow for decompilation of various functions that rely on them.

  Otherwise, the game has been tested to completion with no known issues.
