### King's Quest I SCI (KQ1)
  Game version 1.00.051
  Interpreter version S.old.010

  In rooms 24 and 38, the moveButterfly script seems to be bugged, and may freeze the game. The problematic code has been commented out, so it may not work as intended.

  Despite this, the game has been tested to completion with no other known issues.
