### The Seasoned Professional
  EGA interpreter version 1.000.172
  
  VGA interpreter version 1.000.174
  
  The EGA and VGA versions use exactly the same scripts.

  This game does not contain a VOCAB.900 file, so SCICompanion will crash if you attempt to compile the User script. The required file, taken from the QFG2 demo, has been included.

  Tested to completion with no known issues.
