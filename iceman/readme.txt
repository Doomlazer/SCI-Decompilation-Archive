### Codename Iceman demo (ICEDEMO)
  Interpreter version 0.000.685

  This game does not contain VOCAB.997, so the one from the SCI0 version of Mixed-Up Mother Goose has been enclosed.

  The Dice room was particularly hard to get decompiled for this reason. Fortunately, it seems to compile and play okay.

  Tested to completion with no known issues.
