### Codename Iceman (ICEMAN)
  Game version 1.033
  Interpreter version 0.000.685

Some debug code from the beta has been restored.

The dice game's anti-restore code has been commented out.
While I liked the idea, the fact that it leads to an unwinnable situation makes it greatly unfair.

Ready for testing.
